# Travel-Booking-Management-System
# Project Overview
The Travel Booking Management System is a simple database project designed to manage travel-related information such as customers, flights, destinations, and bookings.
The system allows users to search for available flights, book tickets, cancel bookings, and view customer or booking reports.
# Problem Statement
Managing travel data manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Airlines and travel agencies require a structured system to store flight schedules, customer details, and booking transactions efficiently.
This project solves that problem using a simple SQL-based database structure that ensures fast retrieval, accurate booking, and easy management.
# Objectives
To design a small but functional relational database for travel bookings.
To create SQL tables with proper relationships and constraints.
To perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
To execute queries for searching flights, creating bookings, and generating reports.
To demonstrate real-time use cases like cancellation and seat availability updates
# Features

Clean database schema
Realistic flight booking use-cases
Insert/update/delete/search operations
Transaction-safe booking logic
Easy to expand into a web app later
# Technologies Used
SQL (SQLite/MySQL/Any RDBMS)
Python (optional interface)
